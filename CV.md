## Research
------
#### Sunyaev lab (2018 - )
#### Novembre lab (Sept. 2012 - 2018)
* Studied the response of deleterious variation in humans to demographic
  change using partial differential equations and analysis of exome sequence
  data.

  pedigree. 
* Developed general mathematical models for quantitative trait distributions.
