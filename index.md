I am a PhD student in the department of [Ecology and Evolution at the University
of Chicago](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/) and the lab of [John
Novembre](https://jnpopgen.org/). I got my undergraduate at the [University of
Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I did research with [Claus
Wilke](http://wilkelab.org/) and then [Mark
Kirkpatrick](https://kirkpatricklab.org/) while learning the basics of
population genetics and computational biology.

My research interests are primarily in population genetics, and my work has used
a combination of mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches. However, I
do have a great love for the study of evolution and genetics more broadly. I
will be graduating within the academic year, and I am now looking for
postdoctoral positions.
