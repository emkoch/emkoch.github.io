My research addresses a variety of topics in population genetics using a
combination of mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches. 

<!-- However, I do have broad interests in the study of evolution and genetics. -->

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in [Shamil Sunyaev's
lab](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/wiki/sunyaevlab/) at Harvard Medical School
and the Genetics Division of Brigham & Women's Hospital. I was previously a PhD
student in the department of [Ecology and Evolution at the University of
Chicago](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/) and the lab of [John
Novembre](https://jnpopgen.org/). 

<!-- Further back in time I was an undergradute -->
<!-- student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I -->
<!-- did research with [Claus Wilke](http://wilkelab.org/) and then [Mark -->
<!-- Kirkpatrick](https://kirkpatricklab.org/) while learning the basics of -->
<!-- population genetics and computational biology. -->
