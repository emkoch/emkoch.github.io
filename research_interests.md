I have pretty broad interests in population and evolutionary genetics. 
This page will provide an overview of topics I am currently pursuing. 

## Dynamics of deleterious genetic variation
One of the more interesting fundamental discoveries to come out of population
genetics within the past couple of decades is that a substantial proportion of
mutations have very slight negative effects on organismal fitness. I am
interested in how the levels of this variation are impacted by the structure and
history of populations as well as it's origin. What regions of the genome tend
to have deleterious consequences for fitness and why?

## General models for quantitative trait distributions
Neutral models for quantitative trait evolution have been useful for identifying
phenotypes under selection in natural populations. However such models tend to
assume that the distribution of breeding values is normal and are generally only
applicable to a particular scale of population or species divergence. I am
interested in developing a general mathematical model for the neutral
distribution of quantitative trait using coalescent theory and making as few
assumptions as possible about the history and structure of populations, the
mutational effect distribution, and the trait architecture.

## Model based analyses of selection during population and species divergence
Many interesting patterns tend to emerge as one examines genome-wide variation
between populations and recently diverged species. Plotting genetic diversity or
divergence along chromosomes may reveal a variety of peaks, valleys, or
plateaus. But what are the evolutionary forces responsible for these patterns?
When evaluating the evidence for different scenarios it helps to have a
predictive model. Simple models models of allele frequency divergence under
background selection, selective sweeps, and balancing selection can be built
with a normal approximation. Fitting these models to population samples of
allele frequencies can allow us to weigh the evidence for different evolutionary
scenarios.
